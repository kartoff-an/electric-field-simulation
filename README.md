# âš¡ Electric Field Simulation
![Electric Field Simulation](/screenshot.png?raw=true)
It is my first web-based interactive simulation built with Three.js that visualizes electric fields due to point charges, charge interactions, and field lines in real-time. It's designed to be visually smooth and educational. I'm using this project to supplement my self-studying in electromagnetics by putting the concepts I'm learning into interactive simulations.

## Features

* **Point Charge Visualization** - Charges can be rendered as colored circles (red for positive, blue for negative).

*  **Dynamic Electric Field Lines** - Real-time field line tracing using Runge-Kutta method based on the current configuration of charges.

*  **Charge Interaction** - Add or remove point charges and change their charge values dynamically. Charges update the field in real-time.

*  **Vector Fields** - Visualize dynamic electric field intensity as vector fields in real-time with smooth, interactive rendering.


... well, I still got some features to add very soon.
